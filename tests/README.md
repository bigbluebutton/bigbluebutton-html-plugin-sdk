# BigBlueButton HTML Plugin SDK Tests

This document provides instructions for installing and running the tests for the BigBlueButton HTML Plugin SDK samples.

## Test Configuration

Test configurations are primarily managed in the `playwright.config.ts` file located in the root directory. This file defines aspects such as:

*   **Reporters:** Uses `list` and `blob` reporters in CI environments, and `list` and `html` (with `open: 'never'`) for local development.
*   **Browser:** Configured to run tests in Chromium.
*   **Viewport:** Default viewport size is 1280x720.
*   **Timeouts:** Default timeouts for actions and expectations are defined, with multipliers for CI environments.

Test files are identified by the `*.spec.ts` pattern on sample folders. Examples include:

*   `samples/sample-actions-bar-plugin/tests/test.spec.ts`
*   `samples/sample-action-button-dropdown-plugin/tests/test.spec.ts`

## Setup

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    The tests are run using **Playwright**. The necessary dependencies are listed in the `devDependencies` section of the main `package.json` file. From the root directory of the SDK, run:

    ```bash
    npm install
    npx playwright install-deps
    npx playwright install
    ```

    This will install all the Playwright required packages.

2.  **Environment Variables:**

      Certain environment variables are used to configure the test environment, particularly for interacting with a BigBlueButton server. These are typically defined in a `.env` file in the root of the project.

      *   **`BBB_URL` (Required):** The URL of the BigBlueButton server to run tests against.
          *   Example: `BBB_URL=https://your.bbb.server/bigbluebutton/api/`
      *   **`BBB_SECRET` (Required):** The shared secret for the BigBlueButton server.
          *   Example: `BBB_SECRET=yoursupersecretkey`
      *   **`TIMEOUT_MULTIPLIER` (Optional):** A numerical value to multiply default timeout values. Useful for slower environments. If not set, it defaults to `2` in CI environments and `1` otherwise.
          *   Example: `TIMEOUT_MULTIPLIER=2`
      *   **`LOCAL_CONTAINER_NAME` (Optional):** The name of the local Docker container running the BigBlueButton server. This is useful when testing against a locally hosted instance of BigBlueButton in a containerized environment.
          *   Example: `LOCAL_CONTAINER_NAME=bbb-local-container`

3.  **Publish sample:**

      The plugin SDK sample tests work with the built plugin [hosted on a BBB Server](/README.md#hosting-the-plugin-on-a-bbb-server).
      - if working on SDK development (e.g. adding `data-test` attribute for testing purposes), you need to publish it to both SDK and core: see [the Building the SDK steps](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-html-plugin-sdk?tab=readme-ov-file#developing-the-sdk).
      
      You need to build the sample:
      ```bash
      # inside sample's folder (with tests implemented)
      npm ci
      npm run build-bundle
      ```

       and then you can either manually copy the built files (`/dist` folder) into the correct directory inside the local container (`/var/www/bigbluebutton-default/assets/plugins`) or just run:

      ```bash
      # when inside sample's folder
      npm run copy-sample-to-container
      ```
      or
      ```bash
      # when in the root
      ./tests/core/scripts/copy-sample-to-container.sh <SAMPLE_PLUGIN_NAME> <LOCAL_CONTAINER>
      ```

      _Note: The entire SDK build process must be repeated whenever changes are made to the SDK or the BBB core. After updating the sample, the newly built files also need to be republishedâ€”both scripts mentioned above handle this by removing the old files and copying in the new ones._

## Running Tests

To execute the test suite, run the following command from the root directory of the SDK:

```bash
npm test
```

This command will execute all `*.spec.ts` files found within the workspace, including those in the `samples` subdirectories.

### Additional commands:

```bash
npm test SAMPLE_NAME  # filter by sample test suite
npm test SAMPLE_NAME -- -g "TEST_NAME"  # filter by test name
npx playwright show-report  # check the full report of your tests
```

You can run all the available commands in a sample folder to use only that specific sample's tests.

### Test Output

*   **Console:** Test results will be printed to the console.
*   **HTML Report:** For local development, an HTML report is generated in the `playwright-report/` directory. This report provides a detailed view of test execution and can be opened by viewing the `index.html` file in that directory or running the command `npx playwright show-report`.
